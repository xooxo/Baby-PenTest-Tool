# Baby-PenTest-Tool
Small project for Cryptography and Network Security course
## Prerequisities:
  • Python 3.5 (it should work with all Python 3.x versions)  
  • python-nmap 0.6.1 ( https://pypi.org/project/python-nmap/ or just type “pip install python-
    nmap” with root privileges)  
  • Scapy  

This tool is for homework and a small tool for pentesting on local network(and remote addresses for
some cases). Program must be run with root privileges and working directory should be where
program is located at. Program can be started via command “python3.5 mert_arikan_hw2.py”. Also,
any Python3 version above 3.5 should work.
